# Python Mini Projects

This repository contains small Python mini projects that I build while learning Python.

Goals:
- Improve problem-solving skills  
- Practice Python fundamentals  
- Apply logic to real-world programs  
- Prepare for open source contribution and GSoC 2026  

Projects will be added step by step as I learn new concepts.
